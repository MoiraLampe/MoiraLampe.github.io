### A long-sighted POMDP Model

**Project description:** 

### Introduction

#### Reinforcement Learning - POMDPs

In the vast landscape of artificial intelligence, one domain stands out for its ability to mimic human learning and decision-making processes â€“ Reinforcement Learning (RL). At its core, RL is about training agents to make sequential decisions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. However, when faced with uncertainties and partial observability, Reinforcement Learning alone may fall short. This is where the intricacies of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) come into play.
