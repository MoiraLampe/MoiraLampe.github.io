## Mathematical Modeling of Filamentous Fungi

**Project description:** This is my own project that I worked on for a year from March 2022 until March 2023 in collaboration with Dr. Claire Guerrier and Prof. Dr. Yves D'Angelo in the form of an internship at the Jean Alexandre Dieudonne Mathematics Laboratory in Nice (France). This project was part of a bigger project called [DREAMS Project](http://www.dyco.fr/index.php/DREAMS). The goal of the project was to look into the biological properties of the filamentous fungus Podospora Anserina, understand its growth factors and create a mathematical model in order to reproduce the physiological growth of this mycelium. This is still an ongoing project that was taken over by Ph.D. student Nicolas Fricker. 

### The story behind this project

In December 2021, I was gifted the book "Entangled Life" by Merlin Sheldrake. As I was reading this, a whole new world opened up in front of me. I was so fascinated by the incredible significance of these organisms. What left a lasting impression is that fungi play a remarkable role in our environment. 

They coexist with us in various forms: They inhabit both the interiors and exteriors of human and animal bodies, permeate the soil, air, waters, and even make their way into our food (Heilmann-Clausen et al., 2015). While the iconic image of a mushroom may come to mind, fungi also thrive in less visible but equally crucial networks known as mycelium.

What makes these organisms truly extraordinary is their role as builders of efficient communication networks. Fungi actively contribute to the establishment of symbiotic relationships between plants and trees, fostering the health of ecosystems. Additionally, fungi share biological structures similar to higher organisms. As interconnected networks, their mycelium has been found to operate analogously to the neural pathways of brains. In fact, a mere kilogram of soil contains approximately 200 kilometers or more of mycelium, forming a network with more connections than the neural pathways of the human brain.

Due to their versatile nature, fungi have enormous application potential in industry. They have the ability to digest pollutants and decompose food, to absorb carbon dioxide into the soils, nourish and kill plants and making medicine (Ferreira et al., 2020). They are also widely applicable in agriculture with their ability to produce a wide range of bioactive metabolites, which can improve plant growth (Mirmajlessi and Radhakrishnan, 2020). Hence, it is clear that fungi are indispensable organisms and enhancing the understanding of their underlying mechanisms may hold the key to understanding crucial processes on Earth (Moore et al., 2020).

Below you can see a type of filamentous fungi called Podospora Anserina growing into an expansive network. This is an image that was taken at the [Laboratoire interdisciplinaire des Energies de Demain](https://b2c.sdv.univ-paris-diderot.fr/) (LIED) in Paris which we are working with. And the idea of the project I took part in was to understand in various ways how this microorganism is growing into a network and thriving in its environment.

These revelations from "Entangled Life" inspired a project that would explore and celebrate the multifaceted contributions of these fascinating organisms.

The project is called [DREAMS Project](http://www.dyco.fr/index.php/DREAMS) and is divided into a biological part, a physics part, and a mathematical part, which is the one I was working on. The main goal is to address the modeling and analysis of the expanding interconnected hyphal network (the vegetative filaments produced to form the mycelium) of the fungus Podospora Anserina. 

A fundamental question that arises is how these microorganisms work and are build up on a molecular and cellular level, how they expand into growing networks and how the environment they are exposed to influences these factors. Although much research has been done on mycelium growth and branching (Lew, 2011; Jackson and Heath, 1993; Regaladot, 1998; Steinberg et al., 2017; Bartnicki-Garcia, 1990), it remains unclear how the fungus’ interaction with the environment influences these processes.

### A toy model: Podospora Anserina

### Some definitions

The elongated cell at the edge of the network, is referred to as hypha.
