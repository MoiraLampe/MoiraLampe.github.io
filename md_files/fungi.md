## Mathematical Modeling of Filamentous Fungi

**Project description:** From March 2022 to March 2023, I collaborated with [Dr. Claire Guerrier](https://math.univ-cotedazur.fr/~guerrier/) and [Prof. Dr. Yves D’Angelo](http://www.dyco.fr/index.php/User:Yd) during an internship at the [Jean Alexandre Dieudonne Mathematics Laboratory](https://math.univ-cotedazur.fr/) in Nice (France) to work on my own project. This was part of a larger initiative called [DREAMS](http://www.dyco.fr/index.php/DREAMS), studying the constrained hyphal growth in the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina. 

The goal of my project was to create a mathematical model to better understand the growth factors of the filamentous fungus called Podospora Anserina. This project was conducted in collaboration with the [Laboratoire interdisciplinaire des Energies de Demain](https://b2c.sdv.univ-paris-diderot.fr/), which played a crucial role in executing experiments and collecting experimental data to validate the models developed. This ongoing project has been taken over by Ph.D. student Nicolas Fricker in March 2023, ensuring its continued progress.

### The story behind this project

In December 2021, I was gifted a copy of "Entangled Life" written by Merlin Sheldrake, a book that ended up opening up a whole new world in front of me. I was so fascinated by the incredible significance of these organisms that live among us in as many as 5 million species but are yet so invisible. 

Not only do fungi manifest themselves as well-known mushrooms that grow and are visible in nature, but they also thrive in the form of expansive interconnected networks, the mycelium. They are the unseen parts of mushrooms, hidden beneath the forest floor, serving as their ”roots”.

I find it especially intriguing how these organisms build efficient communication networks and thereby actively contribute to the establishment of symbiotic relationships between plants and trees, fostering the health of ecosystems. 

As a computational neuroscientist I cannot miss out on mentioning that mycelium has been found to operate analogously to the neural pathways of brains. In fact, a mere kilogram of soil contains approximately 200 kilometers or more of mycelium, forming a network with more connections than the neural pathways of the human brain.

What left a lasting impression on me is that fungi play a remarkable role in our environment. They have the ability to digest pollutants and decompose food, to absorb carbon dioxide into the soils, nourish and kill plants and making medicine (Ferreira et al., 2020). They are also widely applicable in agriculture with their ability to produce a wide range of bioactive metabolites, which can improve plant growth (Mirmajlessi and Radhakrishnan, 2020).

Below you can see a type of filamentous fungus called Podospora Anserina growing into an expansive network. This is an image that was taken at the [Laboratoire interdisciplinaire des Energies de Demain](https://b2c.sdv.univ-paris-diderot.fr/) (LIED) in Paris. 

### The Mycelium, a growing Network

These revelations from "Entangled Life" inspired a project that would explore and celebrate the multifaceted contributions of these fascinating organisms. And the idea of the project I took part in was to understand in various ways how this microorganism is growing into a network and thriving in its environment.

### Some definitions

The elongated cell at the edge of the network, is referred to as hypha.
