# Foraging the Model Forest

## A Journey through Computational Neuroscience- and Biology, and Machine Learning.

Iâ€™m a Computational Neuroscientist with experience in Machine Learning and Data Science.  

I am fascinated by the complexities of the human mind and how it shapes our decision-making. Simultaneaously I am fascinated by how data shapes everyday decision-making in various parts of industry, including medical decisions, sustainability, etc. All of these have one thing in common: 
the idea of exploring or searching through a diverse and complex landscape of models. As the word "foraging" implies, we need to purposefully explore to find valuable insights or optimal solutions within the "model forest". This is a process that helps to learn by trial and error (reinforcement learning).

So far, my journey has been all about exploring the intersections of Applied Mathematics and AI tools in Neuro- and Cognitive Sciences.
