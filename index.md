<!-- Iâ€™m a Computational Neuroscientist with experience in Machine Learning and Data Science. 

more of an entry close to my master thesis intro, then explain that I am interested in these complexities of our human mind. Then already lead into my first project master thesis.  then also about simulating, for what is useful for society, fungi etc. (take notes from lausanne company) fungi project. and then keep going about how I am interested in using data in real life to make these decisions, and networks that might be derived from human logic. then ai ml dl projects 

ML: focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy

I am fascinated by the complexities of the human mind and how it shapes our decision-making. Simultaneaously I am fascinated by how data shapes everyday decision-making in various parts of industry, including medical decisions, sustainability, etc. All of these have one thing in common: 
the idea of exploring or searching through a diverse and complex landscape of models. As the word "foraging" implies, we need to purposefully explore to find valuable insights or optimal solutions within the "model forest". This process of learning by trial and error is also referred to as reinforcement learning.

<!--So far, my journey has been all about exploring the intersections of Applied Mathematics and AI tools in Neuro- and Cognitive Sciences.-->
